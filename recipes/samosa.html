 <h2>Steps to make samosa:</h2>
 <ol>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine flour, ajwain seeds, oil (or ghee), and salt. Mix thoroughly for 1–2 minutes.</li>
    <li>Gradually add water, starting with ¼ cup, and mix. Add another ¼ cup of water and knead until the dough is tight. If needed, add 1–2 tbsp of water to adjust consistency.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough well and let it rest for 15–20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Divide the dough into small balls and roll out each ball into a thin sheet. Cut the sheet into halves to make samosa sheets.</li>
    <li>In a pan, heat oil and add cumin seeds, green chilies, and ginger. Stir fry for a minute.</li>
    <li>Add the mashed potatoes, green peas, and spices. Mix well and cook for 2–3 minutes. Add coriander leaves and mint leaves, then turn off the heat.</li>
    <li>Let the filling cool down.</li>
    <li>Take a samosa sheet and fold it into a cone shape. Brush the edges with water and seal them tightly.</li>
    <li>Fill the cone with the potato mixture, ensuring not to overfill. Seal the edges with water.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in a pan over medium-low heat. Once the oil is hot, carefully place the samosas in the pan and fry until golden brown.</li>
    <li>Remove the samosas with a slotted spoon and place them on a plate lined with paper towels to drain excess oil.</li>
    <li>Serve hot with chutney or your favorite dipping sauce.</li>
